# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# User.create(username: "bobsaget", email: "bobbysags@gmail.com", password_digest: "123")
# Recipe.create(name: "Chicken Parmesan", prep_time: 10, cook_time: 20, ingredients: "1/2 Chicken breast, 2 tbsp")
